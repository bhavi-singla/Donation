      VOSD is the world’s largest ecosystem of no-kill rescue, rehabilitation
      and lifelong care for dogs, and the services that support it. We call this
      the VOSD Charity for Stray dogs. VOSD is located in Delhi, India, and
      hundreds of rescued dogs reside here lifelong without ever

      Animals who are suffering in India have strong indigenous allies. The
      nation is blessed with many dedicated animal welfare organizations. Help
      Animals India seeks out the best of India's under-funded animal rights
      organizations to provide financial & practical assistance where it can
      make the most difference. The Voice of stray dogs strives not only to
      achieve immediate assistance for India’s animals, but to nurture an
      enduring culture of protecting animals in India. This builds capacity
      through education, consultation, networking, and financial support, which
      enables these groups to fulfill their aims, grow, and most importantly,
      help more animals..

    <h3 style="text-align: center; margin: 1%;">THE VOSD VISION</h3>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;  margin: 1% auto;">‘Voice of Stray Dogs’ was founded on the principle that no dog will ever be
    euthanised because of lack of space, money or resources. Since we started,
    no dog ever has EVER been. Each dog has the best, most sophisticated and
    most expensive medical care in India. So far, VOSD has rescued 8,000+ dogs,
    given 250,000+ state-of-the-art free treatments, and we continue to provide
    hundreds of treatments every day. The VOSD Dog Sanctuary & Hospital Each
    year 200-250 dogs join our VOSD family. These are dogs who have been
    formerly blinded with acid, run over and paralysed, sexually assaulted,
    slashed with knives or tied to train tracks to die. Dogs not just from
    Punjab but from Haryana, Delhi, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Rajasthan and many other
    cities to reside permanently at VOSD. Dogs who come here are never kept in
    chains or isolated. They have access to their own hospital, a fleet of
    ambulances and 24×7 water and power supply (even though we’re in a remote
    location). The dogs here also have agility parks and a jet-powered
    hydrotherapy pool. 600+ trees provide shade here, in what was earlier barren
    land. All dogs are free within their 50+ enclosures in a 3.5-acre area. Each
    enclosure has an enclosed ‘indoor’ as well as an open area, lined with
    trees. The enclosures have heaters during the winter; and individual water
    bodies for the dogs to jump into and cool off during the summer. This is the
    home of not just India’s most ‘unadoptable’ dogs, but also of ‘Patriot Dogs’
    — India’s service dogs who have been retired from the Police,
    Reserve Police, Railway Police, Kerala Police and the Indian Army.</h4>
